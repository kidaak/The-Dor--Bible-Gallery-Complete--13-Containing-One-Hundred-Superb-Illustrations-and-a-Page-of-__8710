<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<p>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
pray. And when, even was come, the ship was in the midst of the
sea, and he alone on the land. And he saw them toiling in rowing;
for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourths watch
of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would
have passed: by them. But when they saw him walking upon the sea,
they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out: for they all
saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them,
and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not
afraid.</p>

<p>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
wondered. For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for
their heart was hardened.&mdash;Mark vi, 46-52.</p>

<p>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against
you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with
her: loose them, and bring the unto me. And if any man say ought
unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and
straightway he will send them.</p>

<p>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy
King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass'; and a colt
the foal of an ass.</p>

<p>And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, and
brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and
they set him thereon.</p>

<p>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
others cut down branches; from the trees, and strewed them in the
way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed,
cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus the
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.&mdash;Matthew xxi, I-II.</p>

<p>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>

<p>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not
the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it
lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall
we not give?</p>

<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye
me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they brought it.</p>

<p>And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</p>

<p>And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's.</p>

<p>And they marveled at him.&mdash;Mark xii, 13-17.</p>

<p>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast
in much.</p>

<p>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his
disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this
poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into
the treasury: for all they did cast in of their abundance; but
she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her
living.&mdash;Mark xii, 13-17</p>

<h2>RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.</h2>

<p>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, and
besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the
point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that
she may be healed and she shall live. And Jesus went with him;
and much people followed him, and thronged him.</p>

<p>And a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years,
and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew,
worse, when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
touched his garment. For she said, If I may touch but his
clothes, I shall be whole. And straightway the fountain of her
blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed
of that plague. And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that
virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and
said, Who touched my clothes? And his disciples said unto him,
Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who
touched me? And he looked round about to see her that had done
this thing. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was
done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
truth. And he said unto her Daughter, thy faith hath made the
whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>

<p>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why
troublest thou the Master any further? As soon as Jesus heard the
word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue,
Be not afraid, only believe. And he suffered no man to follow
him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. And he
cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the
tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. And when he was
come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the
damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the
mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth
in where the damsel was lying. And he took the damsel by the
hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being
interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. And straightway the
damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years.
And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p>

<p>And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
commanded that something should be given her to eat.&mdash;Mark v,
22-43.</p>

<p>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
is my neighbor?</p>

<p>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him
of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half
dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way:
and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise
a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and
passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had
compassion on him. And went to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and
brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow
when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the
host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of
these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among
the thieves?</p>

<p>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.</p>

<p>Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.&mdash;Luke x,
29-37.</p>

<p>Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>

<p>And he said, a certain man had two sons: and the younger of
them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods
that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</p>

<p>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there
arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and
he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have
filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no
man gave unto him.</p>

<p>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired
servants.</p>

<p>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran,
and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his
servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a
ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither the
fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this
my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.
And they began to be merry.</p>

<p>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one
of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>

<p>And he said unto him, thy brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
sound.</p>

<p>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
father out, and intreated him. And he answering said to his
father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither
transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never
gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as
soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living
with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>

<p>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be
glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was
lost, and is found.&mdash;Luke xv, 10-32</p>

<h2>LAZARUS AND THE RICH MAN.</h2>

<br>

<p>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>

<p>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs
came and licked his sores.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was
buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried
and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my
tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>

<p>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all this,
between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they
which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass
to us, that would come from thence.</p>

<p>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
wouldest send him to my father's house: for I have five brethren;
that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this
place of torment.</p>

<p>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
them hear them.</p>

<p>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
from the dead, they will repent.</p>

<p>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the
dead.&mdash;Luke xvi, 19-31</p>

<p>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.</p>

<p>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
and the other a publican; The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I
fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And
the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up as much as his
eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his
house justified rather than the other: for every: one that
exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted. Luke xviii, 9-14.</p>

<br>

<p>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth
hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
unto her, Give me to drink.</p>

<p>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy
meat.)</p>

<p>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for
the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>

<p>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
water.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living
water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
cattle?</p>

<p>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that
I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
everlasting life.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
The woman answered and said, I have no husband.</p>

<p>Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not
thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that
in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship
the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship;
for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is,
when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a
Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
in truth.</p>

<p>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>

<p>And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked
with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
talkest thou with her?</p>

<p>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me all
things, that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went
out of the city, and came unto him.&mdash;John iv 5-30</p>
