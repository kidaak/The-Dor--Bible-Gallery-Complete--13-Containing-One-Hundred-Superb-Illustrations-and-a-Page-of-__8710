<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<p>Then sang Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam on that day,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, When the people
willingly offered themselves. Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye
princes; I, even I, will sing unto the Lord; I will sing praise
to the Lord God of Israel. Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir,
When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled,
and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. The
mountains melted from before the Lord, Even that Sinai from
before the Lord God of Israel.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
be; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent. He asked water,
and she gave him milk; She brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's
hammer; And with the hammer she smote Sisera, She smote off his
head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples. At
her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: At her feet he bowed, he
fell: Where he bowed, there he fell down dead. The mother of
Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why
is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his
chariots? Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer
to herself, Have they not sped? Have they not divided the prey;
To every man a damsel or two; To Sisera a prey of divers colours,
a prey of divers colours of needlework, Of divers colours of
needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
the spoil? So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: But let them
that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
Judges v, 2-5, 24-31</p>

<h2>JEPHTHAH MET BY HIS DAUGHTER.</h2>

<p>Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed
over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and
from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
Ammon.</p>

<p>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou
shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my
house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of
Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a
burnt offering.</p>

<p>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands. And he
smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very
great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before
the children of Israel.</p>

<p>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and
she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
daughter. Judges xi, 29-34.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very
low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened
my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.</p>

<p>And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath
proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken
vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
Ammon. And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for
me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</p>

<p>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
mountains.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow
which he had vowed: and she knew no man.</p>

<p>And it was a custom in Israel, that the daughters of Israel
went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four
days in a year. Judges xi, 35-40.</p>

<p>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath; and, behold, a
young lion roared against him. And the Spirit of the Lord came
mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid,
and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his
mother what he had done. Judges xiv, 5-6.</p>

<p>And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</p>

<p>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth,
and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven
hundred pieces of silver.</p>

<p>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
afflict thee. And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with
seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak,
and be as another man. Then the lords of the Philistines brought
up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she
bound him with them. Now there were men lying in wait, abiding
with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow
is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not
known.</p>

<p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest
be bound. And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with clew
ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as
another man. Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him
therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And
he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</p>

<p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And
he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with
the web. And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep,
and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web.</p>

<p>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. And
it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and
urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; that he told
her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor
upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my
mother's womb if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me,
and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.</p>

<p>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up
this once, for he hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of
the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their
hand. And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head;
and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. And
she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out
of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before,
and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from
him. Judges xvi, 4-20.</p>

<h2>THE DEATH OF SAMSON.</h2>

<br>

<p>But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
and he did grind in the prison house.</p>

<p>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
shaven.</p>

<p>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice:
for they said, Our God hath delivered Samson our enemy into our
hand. And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for
they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and
the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. And it came
to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for
Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out
of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him
between the pillars. And Samson said unto the lad that held him
by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the
house standeth, that I may lean upon them. Now the house was full
of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were
there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and
women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p>

<p>And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God,
remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
Philistines for my two eyes. And Samson took hold of the two
middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was
borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with
his left. And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And
he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the
lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead
which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in
his life.</p>

<p>Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he
judged Israel twenty years.&mdash;Judges xvi; 21-31</p>

<br>

<p>Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
his wife, and his two sons. And the name of the man was
Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his
two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And
they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. And
Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
sons. And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of
the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt
there about ten years. And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of
them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</p>

<p>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country
of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them
bread. Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was,
and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way
to return unto the land of Judah.</p>

<p>And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have
dealt with the dead, and with me. The Lord grant you that ye may
find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.</p>

<p>Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and
wept. And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee
unto thy people.</p>

<p>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your
husbands? Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old
to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have
a husband also to night, and should also bear sons; would ye
tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from
having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for
your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.</p>

<p>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
kissed her mother in law but Ruth cleave unto her.</p>

<p>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
people, and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in
law.</p>

<p>And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will
I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but
death part thee and me.</p>

<p>When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,
then she left speaking unto her.</p>

<p>So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem.&mdash;Ruth i,
1-19.</p>

<h2>RUTH AND BOAZ.</h2>

<br>

<p>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</p>

<p>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. And she went,
and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap
was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was
of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>

<p>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord
bless thee. Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the
reapers, Whose damsel is this? And the servant that was set over
the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that
came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: and she said, I
pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the
sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning
until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</p>

<p>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide
here fast by my maidens: let thine eyes be on the field that they
do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men
that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go
unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have
drawn.</p>

<p>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and
said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou
shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</p>

<p>And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy
mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people
which thou knewest not heretofore. The Lord recompense thy work,
and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under
whose wings thou art come to trust.</p>

<p>Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for
that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
thine handmaidens.</p>

<p>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did
eat, and was sufficed, and left. And when she was risen up to
glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even
among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and let fall also some
of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may
glean them and rebuke her not.</p>

<p>So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.&mdash;Ruth ii.

<p>And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines
seven months. And the Philistines called for the priests and the
diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell
us wherewith we shall send it to his place. And they said, If ye
send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in
any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed,
and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from
you. Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five
golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God
of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,
and from off your gods, and from off your land. Wherefore then do
ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened
their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did
they not let the people go, and they departed? Now therefore make
a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no
yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home
from them: and take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the
cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a
trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it
away, that it may go. And see, if it goeth up by the way of his
own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil:
but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote
us; it was a chance that happened to us.</p>

<p>And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
the cart, and shut up their calves at home: and they laid the ark
of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold
and the images of their emerods. And the kine took the straight
way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway,
lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to
the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them, unto
the border of Beth-shemesh. And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping
their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes,
and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. And the cart came into
the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there
was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and
offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord.</p>

<p>And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer
that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them
on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt
offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the
Lord.&mdash;1 Samuel vi, 1-5.</p>

<h2>SAUL AND DAVID.</h2>

<p>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that
day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.</p>

<p>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that
was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his
sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</p>

<p>And David went out withersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was
accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of
Saul's servants.</p>

<p>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all
cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with
tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music. And the women
answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain
his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>

<p>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
said, "They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but
the kingdom?"  And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was
a javelin in Saul's hand. And Saul cast the javelin; for he said,
I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided
out of his presence twice.&mdash;1 Samuel xviii, I-II.</p>

<h2>DAVID SPARING SAUL.</h2>

<p>And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
the wilderness of Engedi. Then Saul took three thousand chosen
men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon
the rocks of the wild goats. And he came to the sheepcotes by the
way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and
David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p>

<p>And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into
thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto
thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe
privily. And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote
him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his
men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master,
the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him,
seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.</p>

<p>So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave,
and went on his way. David also arose afterward, and went out of
the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And
when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the
earth and bowed himself.</p>

<p>And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold, this day thine
eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee to-day into
mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye
spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against
my lord; for he is the Lord's anointed. Moreover, my father, see,
yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off
the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see
that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I
have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take
it. The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of
thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. As saith the proverb
of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine
hand shall not be upon thee. After whom is the king of Israel
come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a
flea. The Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine
hand.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son
David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. And he said to
David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me
good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. And thou hast shewed
this day how that thou hast dealt well, with me: forasmuch as
when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me
not. For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto
me this day. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely
be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in
thine hand. Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou
wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy
my name out of my father's house.</p>

<p>And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
his men gat them up unto the hold.&mdash;2 Samuel xxiv, 2&mdash;22.</p>
