<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<h2>THE TRIAL OF THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM.</h2>

<p>And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I
am. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will
tell thee of.</p>

<p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up and went unto
the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day
Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. And
Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and
I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon
Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and
they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his
father, and said, My father: and he, said, Here am I, my son. And
he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for
a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide
himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them
together. And they came to the place which God had told him of;
and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And
Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his
son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and
said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay
not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him:
for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up
his eyes and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a
thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and
offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</p>

<p>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it
is to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</p>

<p>And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven
the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the
Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless
thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed
shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my
voice.&mdash;Geneszs xxii. 1-18.</p>

<h2>THE BURIAL OF SARAH.</h2>

<p>And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these
were the years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in
Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan and
Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</p>

<p>And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
sons of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:
give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury
my dead out of my sight.</p>

<p>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold
from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</p>

<p>And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
land, even to the children of Heth. And he communed with them,
saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my
sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which
is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he
shall give it me for a possession of a burying-place amongst
you.</p>

<p>And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,
even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, Nay, my
lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is
therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people
give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>

<p>And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I
will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will
bury my dead there.</p>

<p>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, My lord, hearken
unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver: what
is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</p>

<p>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons
of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the
merchant.</p>

<p>And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was
before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all
the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders
round about, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession in the
presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the
gate of his city.</p>

<p>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
the field of Machpelah before Mamre; the same is Hebron in the
land of Canaan. And the field, and the cave that is therein, were
made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the
sons of Heth.&mdash;Genesis xxiii.</p>

<p>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>

<p>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand:
and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And
he made his camels to kneel down, without the city by a well of
water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out
to draw water. And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I
pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my
master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and
the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw: water: and
let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall
say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same
be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and
thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my
master.</p>

<p>And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the
wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her
shoulder. And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin,
neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
filled her pitcher and came up. And the servant ran to meet her,
and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy
pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hasted, and let
down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. And when she
had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy
camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted and
emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well
to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</p>

<p>And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold: and said,
Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee; is there room in
thy father's house for us to lodge in? And she said unto him, I
am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto
Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and
provender enough, and room to lodge in.</p>

<p>And the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord. And he
said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not
left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in
the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's
brethren.</p>

<p>And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
things.&mdash;Genesis xxiv, 9-28.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau, his eldest
son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
here am I. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day
of my death: Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy
quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some
venison; And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it
to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I
die.</p>

<p>And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</p>

<p>And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me venison,
and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before
the Lord before my death. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice
according to that which I command thee. Go now to the flock, and
fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make
them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth; And thou
shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may
bless thee before his death.</p>

<p>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: My father peradventure
will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall
bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</p>

<p>And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</p>

<p>And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. And
Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and
upon the smooth of his neck: And she gave the savoury meat and
the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son
Jacob.</p>

<p>And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
Here am I; who art thou, my son? And Jacob said unto his father,
I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest
me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul
may bless me. And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou
hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord
thy God brought it to me. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I
pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very
son Esau or not. And Jacob went; near unto Isaac his father; and
he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands
are the hands of Esau. And he discerned him not, because his
hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed
him.</p>

<p>And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. And
he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,
that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and
he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank. And his father
Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. And he
came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his
raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is
as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed: Therefore
God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,
and plenty of corn and wine: Let people serve thee, and nations
bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's
sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and
blessed be he that blesseth thee.&mdash;Genesis xxvii. 1-29.</p>

<p>And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
father's sheep: for she kept them. And it came to pass, when
Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and
the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near,
and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock
of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and
lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he was
her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran
and told her father.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all
these things. And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and
my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. And Laban
said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou
therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages
be?</p>

<p>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah was tender eyed; but
Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.</p>

<p>And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said, It is
better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to
another man; abide with me.</p>

<p>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
him but a few days, for the love he had for her. And Jacob said
unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I
may go in unto her.</p>

<p>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
a feast. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah
his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid, for an
handmaid. And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was
Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me?
did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
beguiled me? And Laban said, It must not be so done in our
country, to give the younger before the firstborn. Fulfil her
week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou
shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>

<p>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him
Rachel his daughter to wife also. And Laban gave to Rachel his
daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. And he went in also
unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served
with him yet seven other years.&mdash;Genesis xxix, 9-30.</p>

<p>These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad
was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his
father's wives; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil
report. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of
many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved
him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not
speak peaceably unto him.</p>

<p>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
they hated him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray
you, this dream which I have dreamed. For, behold, we were
binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also
stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and
made obeisance to my sheaf. And his brethren said to him, Shalt
thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion
over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for
his words.</p>

<p>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the
sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. And
he told it to his father and to his brethren; and his father
rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth. And his brethren envied
him; but his father observed the saying.</p>

<p>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in
Shechem.</p>

<p>And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
them, they conspired against him to slay him. And they said one
to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now, therefore, and
let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say,
Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will
become of his dreams. And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him
out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. And Reuben
said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is
in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors
that was on him; and they took him and cast him into a pit; and
the pit was empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to
eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold,
a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels
bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to
Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we
slay our brother, and conceal his blood? Come, and let us sell
him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he
is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</p>

<p>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver; and they brought Joseph
into Egypt.</p>

<p>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.&mdash;Genesis xxxvii,
2&mdash;12, 17-28, 36</p>

<h2>JOSEPH INTERPRETING PHARAOH'S DREAM.</h2>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there
came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and
fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow. And, behold, seven other
kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and
lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the
river. And the ill favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the
seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>

<p>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold,
seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after
them. And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full
ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt,
and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream;
but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p>[At the suggestion of his chief butler Pharaoh sends for
Joseph and relates to him his dreams, which Joseph interprets as
follows:]</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good kine
are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the
dream is one. And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came
up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted
with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. This is the
thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do
he sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there come seven years of great
plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: And there shall arise
after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be
forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the
land; and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. And for
that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the
thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to
pass.</p>

<p>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
and set him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let
him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of
the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. And let them
gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up
corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the
cities. And that food shall be for store to the land against the
seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that
the land perish not through the famine.&mdash;Genesis xli. 1-36.</p>

<h2>JOSEPH MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS BRETHREN.</h2>

<br>

<p>Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known
unto his brethren. And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the
house of Pharaoh heard.</p>

<p>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
troubled at his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come
near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am
Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be
not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither:
for God did send me before you to preserve life. For these two
years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five
years, in which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. And
God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth,
and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not
you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to
Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all
the land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto
him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all
Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: And thou shalt dwell in the
land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy
children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast. And there will I nourish thee; for
yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household,
and all that thou hast, come to poverty. And, behold, your eyes
see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth
that speaketh unto you. And ye shall tell my father of all my
glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste
and bring down my father hither.</p>

<p>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover he kissed all his brethren,
and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with
him.</p>

<p>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
Joseph's brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his
servants.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, say unto thy brethren, This do
ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the
fat of the land.&mdash;Genesis xlv, 1-18.</p>

<h2>MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES.</h2>

<p>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and
when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three
months. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him
an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
river's brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would
be done to him.</p>

<p>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when
she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one
of the Hebrews' children. Then said his sister to Pharaoh's
daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew
women, that she may nurse the child for thee? And Pharaoh's
daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the
child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this
child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.
And the woman took the child and nursed it.</p>

<p>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses:
and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.&mdash;Exodus ii,
1-10.</p>

<h2>THE WAR AGAINST GIBEON.</h2>

<br>

<p>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of
Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and
went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon,
and made war against it.</p>

<p>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
quickly, and save us and help us: for all the kings of the
Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
against us.</p>

<p>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men of valor. And the Lord said unto
Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand;
there shall not a man of them stand before thee. Joshua therefore
came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night. And
the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a
great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that
goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto
Makkedah. And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel,
and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down
great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died:
they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>

<p>Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord
delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he
said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still,
and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon
their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the
sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go
down about a whole day. And there was no day like that before it
or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for
the Lord fought for Israel.</p>

<p>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal. But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave
at Makkedah. And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are
found hid in a cave at Makkedah. And Joshua said, Roll great
stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep
them: and stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite
the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities;
for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till
they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered
into fenced cities. Joshua x, 5-20.</p>

<h2>SISERA SLAIN BY JAEL.</h2>

<p>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab, the
father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and
pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
Kedesh.</p>

<p>And they shewed Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was
gone up to Mount Tabor. And Sisera gathered together all his
chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people
that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river
of Kishon.</p>

<p>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord
gone out before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and
ten thousand men after him.</p>

<p>And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots and all
his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera
lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet. But
Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon
the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</p>

<p>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael, the
wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the
king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. And Jael went
out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in
to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the
tent, she covered him with a mantle. And he said unto her, Give
me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And
she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is
there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. Then Jael, Heber's
wife, took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand,
and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples,
and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and
weary. So he died.</p>

<p>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom
thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay
dead, and the nail was in his temples. Judges iv, 2-22.</p>
