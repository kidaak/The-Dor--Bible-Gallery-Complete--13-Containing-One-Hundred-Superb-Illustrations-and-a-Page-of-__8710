<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<p>Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
mount Gilboa. And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and
upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab,
and Melchshua, Saul's sons.</p>

<p>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto
his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through
therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through,
and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore
afraid. Therefore, Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. And when
his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon
his sword, and died with him.</p>

<p>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
all his men, that same day together.</p>

<p>And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the
men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they
forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them. And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines
came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
fallen in mount Gilboa. And they cut off his head, and stripped
off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round
about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the
people. And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth and
they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</p>

<p>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which
the Philistines had done to Saul; all the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his
sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt
them there. And they took their bones, and buried them under a
tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 1 Samuel xxxi.</p>

<p>And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. And
David set forth a third part of the people under the hand of
Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai
the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go
forth with you myself also.</p>

<p>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us:
therefore now it is better that thou succor us out of the
city.</p>

<p>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out
by hundreds and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young
man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king
gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>

<p>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
battle was in the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel
were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a
great slaughter that day, of twenty thousand men. For the battle
was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the
wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>

<p>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between
the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went
away.</p>

<p>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold I
saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p>

<p>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?
and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a
girdle.</p>

<p>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged
thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the
young man Absalom. Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood
against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king,
and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against me.</p>

<p>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. And ten
young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote
Absalom, and slew him. And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people
returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the
people. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in
the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
Israel fled every one to his tent.&mdash;2 Samuel xviii, 1-17.</p>

<p>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
the king tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his
enemies. And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this
day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. Then said
Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi
bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. Then said Ahimaaz the son of
Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also
run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son,
seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But howsoever, said he
let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the
way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>

<p>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes,
and looked, and behold a man running alone. And the watchman
cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone,
there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called
unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And
the king said, He also bringeth tidings. And the watchman said,
Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man,
and cometh with good tidings.</p>

<p>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
said, Blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath delivereth up the
men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. And the
king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered,
When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a
great tumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king said unto
him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood
still.</p>

<p>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
king: for the Lord bath avenged thee this day of all them that
rose up against thee. And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young
man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the
king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that
young man is.</p>

<p>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O
Absalom, my son, my son!</p>

<p>And it was told Joab, Behold the king weepeth and mourneth for
Absalom. And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto
all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king
was grieved for his son. And the people gat them by stealth that
day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they
flee in battle.</p>

<p>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!&mdash;2 Samuel
xviii, 19 33; xix, 1-4.</p>

<p>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
daughters born to David. And these be the names of those that
were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and
Nathan, and Solomon, Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and
Japhia, and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.&mdash;2 Samuel v.
13-16.</p>

<p>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her,
and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
Solomon: and the Lord loved him.&mdash;2 Samuel xii, 24.</p>

<p>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David. And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty
years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three
years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father, and his
kingdom was established greatly.&mdash;1 Kings ii, 10-12.</p>

<p>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
shore. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the
children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he
was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and
Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all
nations round about. And he spake three thousand proverbs: and
his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from
the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that
springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl,
and of creeping things, and of fishes. And there came of all
people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the
earth, which had heard of his wisdom.&mdash;2 Kings iv, 29-34.</p>

<p>Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
and stood before him.</p>

<p>And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there
was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
her dead child in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to
give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had
considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I
did bear.</p>

<p>And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
the dead is thy son.</p>

<p>And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and, the living is
my son.</p>

<p>Thus they spake before the king.</p>

<p>Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
and thy son is the dead&mdash;and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is
the dead, and my son is the living. And the king said, Bring me a
sword.</p>

<p>And they brought a sword before the king.</p>

<p>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
half to the one, and half to the other.</p>

<p>Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.</p>

<p>But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but
divide it.</p>

<p>Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof.</p>

<p>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of
God was in him, to do judgment. 1 Kings iii, 16-28.</p>

<p>And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</p>

<p>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, Thou knowest how that David
my father could not build a house unto the name of the Lord his
God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the
Lord put them under the soles of his feet. But now the Lord my
God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither
adversary nor evil occurrent. And, behold: I purpose to build a
house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto
David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne
in thy room, he shall build a house unto my name. Now therefore
command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my
servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give
hire for the servants according to all that thou shalt appoint:
for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to
hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day,
which hath given unto David a wise son over this great, people.
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire
concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir: My
servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou
shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in
giving food for my household.</p>

<p>So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
all his desire.</p>

<p>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave
Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p>

<p>And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
league together.</p>

<p>And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
was thirty thousand men. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten
thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and
two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy. And Solomon
had three score and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore
thousand hewers in the mountains beside the chief of Solomon's
officers which were over the work, three thousand and
three-hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the
work. And the king commanded and they brought great stones,
costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the'
house. And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew them,
and the stone-squarers; so they prepared timber and stones to
build the house.&mdash;1 Kings v.</p>

<p>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day
in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they
told also to their father. And their father said unto them, What
way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went,
which came, from Judah. And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the
ass. So they saddled him the, ass: and he rode thereon, and went
after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he
said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
And he said, I am. Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and
eat bread. And he, said, I may not return with thee, nor go in
with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in
this place: for it was said to me by the word of the Lord, Thou
shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by
the way that thou camest. He said unto him, I am a prophet also
as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord,
saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may
eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. So he went back
with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back: and he
cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the
Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God
commanded thee, but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk
water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no
bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the
sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
prophet whom he had brought back.</p>

<p>And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the
lion also stood by the carcass.</p>

<p>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the
way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told
it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. And when the prophet
that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is;
the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord:
therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath
torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord, which
he spake unto him. And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me
the ass. And they saddled him.</p>

<p>And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass
and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the
carcass, nor torn the ass.&mdash;2 Kings xiii, II-28.</p>

<h2>ELIJAH DESTROYING THE MESSENGERS OF AHAZIAH.</h2>

<p>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron
whether I shall recover of this disease.</p>

<p>But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto
them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that 'ye go
to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Now therefore thus
saith the Lord, Thou; shalt not come down from that bed on which
thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</p>

<p>And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
them, Why are ye now turned back? And they said unto him, There
came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto
the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Is
it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to
enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not
come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt
surely die. And he said unto them, What manner of man was he
which came up to meet you, and told you these words? And they
answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of
leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the
Tishbite.</p>

<p>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
And he went up to him and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill.
And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come
down. And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I
be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven and
consumed him and his fifty.</p>

<p>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath
the king said, Come down quickly. And Elijah answered and said
unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven,
and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down
from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p>

<p>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his
knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man
of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy
servants, be precious in thy sight. Behold, there came fire down
from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties
with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy
sight.</p>

<p>And the angel of the lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto
the king. And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as
thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of
Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of
his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on
which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>

<p>So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had
spoken.&mdash;2 Kings i, 2-17.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into
heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
Lord hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the
Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
they went down to Beth-el.</p>

<p>And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth
to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will
take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I
know it; hold ye your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Elisha,
tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.
And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p>

<p>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take
away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I
know it; hold ye your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I
pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he
said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not
leave thee. And they two went on.</p>

<p>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
view afar off and they two stood by Jordan.</p>

<p>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
they two went over on dry ground.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken
away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double
portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a
hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from
thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be
so.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and
parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven.&mdash;2 Kings ii, I-II.</p>

<p>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
window. And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri
peace, who slew his master?</p>

<p>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses and he
trod her under foot. And when he was come in, he did eat and
drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for
she is a king's daughter. And they went to bury her: but they
found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms
of her hands. Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he
said, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs
eat the flesh of Jezebel: and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as
dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so
that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.&mdash;2 Kings ix, 30-37.</p>

<h2>ESTHER CONFOUNDING HAMAN.</h2>

<br>

<p>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the
queen.</p>

<p>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall
be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be
performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor
in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be
given me at my petition, and my people at my request: for we are
sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to
perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had
held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the
king's damage.</p>

<p>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
heart to do so?</p>

<p>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked
Haman.</p>

<p>Then, Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. And the
king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the
palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to
Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king.</p>

<p>Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon
Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also
before me in the house?</p>

<p>As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's
face. And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the
king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in
the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</p>

<p>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.&mdash;Esther vii.</p>
