<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<p>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea,
named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple he went to
Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the
body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new
tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great
stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>

<p>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
against the sepulchre.&mdash;Matthew xxvii, 57-61</p>

<p>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to
see the sepulchre.</p>

<p>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
the Lord descended from, heaven, and came and rolled back the
stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like
lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the
keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>

<p>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not
here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen
from the dead and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee;
there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>

<p>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.&mdash;Matthew
xxviii, 1-8.</p>

<h2>THE JOURNEY TO EMMAUS.</h2>

<p>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore
furlongs.</p>

<p>And they talked together of all these things which had
happened. And it came to pass that, while they communed together
and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But
their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>

<p>And the one of them, whose, name was Cleopas, answering said
unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>

<p>And he said unto them, What things?</p>

<p>And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the
people: And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to
be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted
that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside
all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
which were early at the sepulchre; and when they found not his
body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of
angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which
were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the
women had said: but him they saw not.</p>

<p>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>

<p>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>

<p>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained
him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day
is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their
eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their
sight.</p>

<p>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within
us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us
the scriptures?</p>

<p>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>

<p>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.&mdash;Luke xxiv, 13-35.</p>

<p>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had
prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone
rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>And they remembered his words. And returned from the
sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all
the rest. * * *</p>

<p>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore
furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which had
happened. * * *</p>

<p>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. And
they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known
of them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spake, Jesus
himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be
unto you. * * *</p>

<p>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but
tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power
from on high.</p>

<p>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed
them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And
they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
Luke xxiv, 1-2, 8-9, 13-14, 33-36, 49-52.</p>

<p>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was
taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given
commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: to whom also
he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible
proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God: and, being assembled together
with them, commanded them that they should not depart from
Jerusalem, but, wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith
he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water; but
ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</p>

<p>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom of
Israel? And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
and all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
the earth.</p>

<p>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
taken up: and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while
they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two
men stood by them in white apparel.&mdash;Acts i, 1-10</p>

<br><br>

<h2>THE MARTYRDOM OF ST. STEPHEN.</h2>
<br><br>
<a href="images/094.jpg"><img alt="094th.jpg (39K)" src="images/094th.jpg" height="475" width="386"></a>

<br>

<p>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
miracles among the people.</p>

<p>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and
of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. And they
were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he
spake. Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him
speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God. And they
stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came
upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council. And set
up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak
blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: for we
have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered
us.</p>

<p>And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him,
saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p>

<p>Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p>

<p>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: [Stephen
here makes his defense, concluding with a terrible, denunciation
of the Jews as being stiffnecked and persecutors of their
prophets, and as betrayers and murderers of Jesus Christ.]</p>

<p>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
they, gnashed on him with their teeth.</p>

<p>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the
right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened,
and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</p>

<p>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of, the city,
and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a
young man's feet, whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen,
calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</p>

<p>And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>And Saul was consenting unto his death.&mdash;Acts vi, 8-15; vii,
1-2, 54-56; viii, 1.</p>

<br>

<p>And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired
of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found
any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring
them bound unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
shined round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the
earth, and heard a voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the
Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said,
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou
must do.</p>

<p>And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
a voice, but seeing no man.</p>

<p>And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into
Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and neither did
eat nor drink.</p>

<p>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
Behold, I am here, Lord.</p>

<p>And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street
which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for
one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, and hath
seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his
hand on him, that he might receive his sight. Then Ananias
answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil
he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath
authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy
name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings,
and the children of Israel: for I will shew him how great things
he must suffer for my name's sake.</p>

<p>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hash
sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with
the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it
had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose and
was baptized. And when he had received meat, he was
strengthened.</p>

<p>Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at
Damascus. And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues,
that he is the Son of God.&mdash;Acts ix, 1-20.</p>

<h2>THE DELIVERANCE OF ST. PETER.</h2>

<br>

<p>Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
to vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of
John with the sword.</p>

<p>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And
when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered
him to four quarternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after
Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p>

<p>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>

<p>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains:
and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the
angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the
prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up,
saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
sandals: And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment
about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and
wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought
he saw a vision. When they were past the first and the second
ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city;
which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and
passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed
from him.</p>

<p>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me
out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the
people of the Jews.&mdash;Acts xii, 1-11</p>

<h2>PAUL AT EPHESUS.</h2>

<br>

<p>And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus; and
finding certain disciples, he said unto them, Have ye, received
the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have
not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he,
said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said,
Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with
the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they
should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy
Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
And all the men were about twelve.</p>

<p>And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning
the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and
separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one
Tyrannus. And this continued by the space of two years; so that
all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus,
both Jews and Greeks.</p>

<p>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: so that
from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons,
and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went
out of them.</p>

<p>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord
Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And
there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said,
Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in
whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and
prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked
and wounded.</p>

<p>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
Jesus was magnified. And many that believed came, and confessed,
and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts
brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and
they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand
pieces of silver.</p>

<p>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.&mdash;Acts xix,
1&mdash;20.</p>

<h2>PAUL MENACED BY THE JEWS.</h2>

<p>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and
be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all
may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning
thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly,
and keepest the law.</p>

<p>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment
of the days of purification, until that an offering should be
offered for every one of them.</p>

<p>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help:
this is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the
people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks
also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. (For
they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian,
whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</p>

<p>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the
doors were shut. And as they went about to kill him, tidings came
unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an
uproar: who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran
down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the
soldiers, they left beating of Paul. Then the chief captain came
near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two
chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some
cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he
could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to
be carried into the castle. And when he came upon the stairs, so
it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the
people. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying,
Away with him.</p>

<p>And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek? Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest
an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
that were murderers? But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of
Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I
beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</p>

<p>And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs,
and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew
tongue.&mdash;Acts xxi, 23-40.</p>

<p>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. Wherefore I
pray you to take some meat; for this is for your health: for
there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>

<p>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began
to eat. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
meat.</p>

<p>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
sixteen souls.</p>

<p>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
cast out the wheat into the sea. And when it was day, they knew
not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore,
into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust
in the ship. And when they had taken up the anchors, they
committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands,
and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but
the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. And
the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them
should swim out, and escape. But the centurion, willing to save
Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which
could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to
land: and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of
the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
land.</p>

<p>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
called Melita.</p>

<p>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
present rain, and because of the cold.&mdash;Acts xxvii, 33-44;
xxviii, 1-2</p>

<p>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
the fourth beast say, Come and see.</p>

<p>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given
unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword,
and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
earth. Revelation vi, 7-8</p>
