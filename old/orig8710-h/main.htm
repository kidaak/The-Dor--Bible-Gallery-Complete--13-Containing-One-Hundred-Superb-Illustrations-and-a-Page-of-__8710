<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
