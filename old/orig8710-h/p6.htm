<p>This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of
engravings illustrative of the Bible&mdash;the designs being all from
the pencil of the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore.
The original work, from which this collection has been made, met
with an immediate and warm recognition and acceptance among those
whose means admitted of its purchase, and its popularity has in
no wise diminished since its first publication, but has even
extended to those who could only enjoy it casually, or in
fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety, was far
too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this
class, and to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs
upon sacred subjects for art-loving Biblical students generally,
this work was projected and has been carried forward. The aim has
been to introduce subjects of general interest&mdash;that is, those
relating to the most prominent events and personages of
Scripture&mdash;those most familiar to all readers; the plates being
chosen with special reference to the known taste of the American
people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press&mdash;in,
narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the
design. Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the
work, while in progress, was under the pains-taking and careful
scrutiny of artists and scholars not directly interested in the
undertaking, but still having a generous solicitude for its
success. It is hoped, therefore, that its general plan and
execution will render it acceptable both to the appreciative and
friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who would wish
to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
illustrations upon sacred themes.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<center><h2>GUSTAVE DORE.</h2></center>
<br>
<p>The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and
variously gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age
when most men have scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and
are still under the direction and discipline of their masters and
the schools, he had won a brilliant reputation, and readers and
scholars everywhere were gazing on his work with ever-increasing
wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious gifts. He
has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before
unsuspected. He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius,
explored and embellished fields hitherto lying waste, and opened
new and shining paths and vistas where none before had trod. To
the works of the great he has added the lustre of his genius,
bringing their beauties into clearer view and warming them to a
fuller life.</p>

<p>His delineations of character, in the different phases of
life, from the horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic,
attest the versatility of his powers; and, whatever faults may be
found by critics, the public will heartily render their quota of
admiration to his magic touch, his rich and facile rendering of
almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet dormant, in the
human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his various
beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
treasure&mdash;house that his genius is constantly augmenting with
fresh gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent
traits we will refer&mdash;his wonderful rendering of the powers of
Nature.</p>

<p>His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the
Vosges doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind.
There he wandered, and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight
of wood and valley, mountain&mdash;pass and rich ravine, whose variety
of form and detail seems endless to the enchanted eye. He has
caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has laid her hand
upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold and
truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so
patriarchal the giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the'
gazer is at once satisfied and entranced. His vistas lie
slumbering with repose either in shadowy glade or fell ravine,
either with glint of lake or the glad, long course of some
rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of
angry storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or
heavens serene and fair&mdash;another kingdom to his teeming art,
after the earth has rendered all her gifts.</p>

<p>Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January
10, 1833. Of his boyhood we have no very particular account. At
eleven years of age, however, he essayed his first artistic
creation&mdash;a set' of lithographs, published in his native city.
The following year found him in Paris, entered as a 7. student at
the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual work began in 1848, when
his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of Hercules," was given
to the public through the medium of an illustrated, journal with
which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856 were
published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
those for "The Wandering Jew "&mdash;the first humorous and grotesque
in the highest degree&mdash;indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to
fancy; the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles,
shipwrecks, turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and
terrible aspects. Every incident or suggestion that could
possibly make the story more effective, or add to the horror of
the scenes was seized upon and portrayed with wonderful power.
These at once gave the young designer a great reputation, which
was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.</p>

<p>With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her
in her varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest
achievements were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at
home in the actual world also, as witness his designs for
"Atala," "London&mdash;a Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don
Quixote."</p>

<p>When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the
fact considered that in almost every task he attempted none had
ventured before him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly
incredible. To enumerate the immense tasks he undertook&mdash;some
single volumes alone containing hundreds of illustrations&mdash;will
give some faint idea of his industry. Besides those already
mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton, Rabelais,
Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,
Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables,"
and others still.</p>

<p>Take one of these works&mdash;the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don
Quixote"&mdash;and glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor
involved in their production is surprising; but when the quality
of the work is properly estimated, what he accomplished seems
prodigious. No particular mention need be made of him as painter
or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his work as an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful
in appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill
as a violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed
with his pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a
musician.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his
mother&mdash;married, as he expressed it, to her and his art. His
death occurred on January 23, 1883.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own
city.</p>

<p>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) to
be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth
her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid
him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the
inn.</p>

<p>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the
angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
round about them: and they were sore afraid: And the angel said
unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born
this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the
Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste,
and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And
when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which
was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it,
wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
them.</p>

<p>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the
angel before he was conceived in the womb.&mdash;Luke ii.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>THE STAR IN THE EAST.</h2>

<p>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that born King of the Jews? for we
have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>

<p>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the
chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of
them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him; In
Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And
thou Bethlehem! in the land of Juda, are not the least among the
princes of Juda: for out of the shall come a Governor, that shall
rule my people Israel.</p>

<p>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
of them diligently, what time the star appeared. And he sent them
to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young
child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I
may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they
parted; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went
before them, till it came and stood over where the young child
was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
joy.&mdash;Matthew ii, I-10.</p>

<h2>THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.</h2>

</center>
<br>

<p>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there
until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to
destroy him.</p>

<p>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
night, and departed into Egypt: and was there until the death of
Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by
the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.&mdash;Matthew
ii 13-15.</p>

<h2>THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS.</h2>

<br>

<p>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two
years old and under, according to the time which he had
diligently enquired of the wise men.</p>

<p>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation,
and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children,
and would not be comforted, because they are not.&mdash;Matthew ii,
16-18.</p>

<p>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
the passover.</p>

<p>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the
days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in
Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother, knew not of it. But they,
supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey
and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And
when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
seeking him.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were
astonished at his understanding and answers.</p>

<p>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them,
How is it that, ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my
father's business? And they understood not the saying which he
spake unto them.</p>

<p>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her
heart.</p>

<p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and man. Luke ii, 41-52.</p>

<h2>JESUS HEALING THE SICK.</h2>

<br>

<p>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the
people. And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought
unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those
which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy;&mdash;and he healed
them.&mdash;Matthew iv, 23&mdash;24.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>SERMON ON THE MOUNT.</h2>
<br><br>

<br>

<p>And there followed him great multitudes of people from
Galilee, and from Decapolis and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea,
and from beyond Jordan.</p>

<p>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
when he was set, his disciples came unto him. And he opened his
mouth and taught them.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
people were astonished at his doctrine: For he taught them as one
having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>

<p>When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
followed him.&mdash;Matthew iv, 25; v, 1-2, 28-29, viii, I.</p>

<h2>CHRIST STILLING THE TEMPEST.</h2>

<br>

<p>And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,
insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was
asleep. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying,
Lord, save us: we perish. And he saith unto them, Why are ye
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the
winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. But the men
marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds
and the sea obey him?&mdash;Matthew viii, 23-27.</p>

<br>

<p>As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
possessed with a devil. And when the devil was cast out, the dumb
spake: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen
in Israel.</p>

<p>But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
prince of the devils.&mdash;Matthew ix, 32-34</p>

<br>

<p>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
parables, he departed thence. And when he was come into his own
country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they
were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and
these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his
mother called Mary? and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon,
and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then
hath this man all these things?</p>

<p>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his
own house.</p>

<p>And he did not many mighty works there because of their
unbelief.&mdash;Matthew xiii, 53-58</p>

<br>

<p>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck
the ears of corn.</p>

<p>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with
him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar
the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful
to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
him? And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the
sabbath.&mdash;Mark ii, 23-28.</p>
